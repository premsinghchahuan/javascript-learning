// undefined In JavaScript
//, undefined represents the absence of a value.If a variable is declared but the value is not assigned, then the value of that variable will be undefined. For example,
let name;
console.log(name);  // undefined
let my= undefined;
console.log(my); // it is also possible to explicity assign a ariaveble to undefined.//Note: You should avoid explicitly assigning undefined to a variable. Usually, we assign null to variables to indicate "unknown" or "empty" values.
